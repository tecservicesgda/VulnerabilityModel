# Vulnerability Model Service

## Overview
This repository contains a FastAPI service written in Python, designed to create a vulnerability model. It offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods and supports searches in a MongoDB database. The service is documented with OpenAPI and can be easily deployed using Docker Compose.

## Features
- **FastAPI Framework**: Utilizes the modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **CRUD Operations**: Provides Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing vulnerability records.
- **Search Function**: Provides a search function to find vulnerabilites.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Leverages the power of MongoDB for efficient storage and retrieval of data.
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Automatically generates interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) that helps you explore and test the API endpoints.
- **Docker Compose Deployment**: Simplifies deployment with Docker Compose, ensuring consistent environments and easy scalability.
